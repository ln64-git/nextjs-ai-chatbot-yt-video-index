Uh Mr. Morrisy had to cancel several concert uh concerts he was going to give in Connecticut and in Boston actually um over the weekend. He had to cancel those because of credible threats of violence. This follows in a a long spree of similar threats being issued to people who have opinions that are outside of the liberal/leftist orthodoxy. Now Morris is a cool dude. I uh wish I could ask him one question. Why in the song Heaven Knows I'm Miserable Now, why is there a bush sticking out of your back pocket? I'm not sure whether this was some sort of political statement, a joke, or if he was just I don't know, maybe he smoked a little pot before and he just thought it was funny or something like that. Not sure. Really wish that I could get an answer about that. If anyone knows, please let me know. And he's a cool dude. He's one of the few people in rock and entertainment that hasn't sold out. Like, uh, he's like, I've got my opinions. Screw you. That's basically his attitude. uh under huge pressure, I'm sure, behind the scenes to, you know, at least pretend to be leftwing because that happens in the entertainment industry. Uh Morrisy decided not to sell out. This puts him among a very very small cohort within entertainment in general along with like Kevin Sorbo, Tim Allen, he'd be there with Johnny Roden. He never sold out. He doesn't give a [ __ ] Delicious goddamn tea. There aren't many people. Michael Graves, there are only a hand he does a conservative podcast actually. Uh there aren't that many people that get into an industry that is generally it's flooded with drugs and lots of sex stuff and and things like that. And uh a lot of times people make it like he certainly has and they get rich and then they turn into nimi liberals more than anything else because they figure well I'll get attention if I embrace this fad cause whatever it happens to be. you know, sending money to African orphans or, you know, fighting against ISIS, stuff like that. Uh, it can be profitable. You get attention. Um, and left-wingers are are dumb, so they'll, you know, pump you full of money. And I have no doubt that if Morrisy today were to come out and say, you know what, I've seen the light. and he comes out with an Antifa shirt and he's like, you know, Bash the F, man. Donald Trump is evil and releases an album titled Bash the Fash or something like that with such hit songs as Yeah, I brained him officer or uh yeah, Smok and Crack in the Back, stuff like that. He'd sell, you know, millions of that album. In fact, I would encourage him to do exactly that. And it's satirical, so it's build as though it's like a left-wing album like Moricey's Redemption or something like that. and it shows him dressed up as Jesus and and praying to a light in the sky while there's like Anta members in the background beating up cops or something. He should do that, but then it's all satirical. Like it's totally tongue and cheek. Oh my god, that would be funny. Yeah, he should he should do that on his own. Literally just make like some instrumental beats and sing over them or something and follow an album as a joke. Uh but in more serious terms here because I mean it is funny. Uh the fact that he would have to cancel his concerts, he's known as a right-winger. Uh because it's it's asinine. People just want to hear the music. It's like I'm not going to show up at an Arithmix concert or or Annie Lennox is doing, you know, solo karach or something like that. The fact that she's far-left, and she is. She's a rad fem uh and not a transexclusionary one, by the way. She wore the AIDS blood shirt that was fashionable for a while. Gets a lot of attention. gets extra album sales and stuff. It's lucrative. It's like crack basically, only you're selling it instead of smoking it. Most of these people don't even believe in their own political ideologies, trust me. Uh but uh you know, it's lucrative. So there's always that there. But if I'm going but if I go to see the arithmics, I'm there for the music. I don't give a [ __ ] about their politics. Might be an awful lot of lefttoids around me at that point. So I might not even be physically safe. kind of depends on what part of the crowd I'm in at the time, I suppose. But I'm going to be sitting there listening to Sweet Dreams and [ __ ] like that. That's that's the point. You're a musician. Moresy is the same. Go ahead and disagree with his uh fairly conservative views. That's fine. When you're calling in death threats to people, and by the way, when you do that, you know, you always run the risk of getting arrested for having done so. I suppose they have to be behind seven boxies. Some of you will get the reference. Oh, it's all gone. How sad. But uh yeah, a lot of people Billy Corgan's another good example. Actually, Billy Corgan hasn't sold out. I don't know that he's particularly political anyway, but what that time when he was at Disneyland that one time and there's a picture of him in the roller coaster and he's glaring at the camera looking like it's the saddest day of his life. And then they asked him, "Why aren't you smiling? You know, you were at Disney World, Disneyland, one of the two." And he's like, "What the [ __ ] do you want from me? Just leave me alone." Oh yeah, good times. Billy Corgan, another rocker that didn't sell out that I would really love to meet. He's pretty cool. He uh never lost it. Meanwhile, you've got idiots that they go way way far left. It's like it's one thing if you were like an anarcho punk band to begin with. Okay. Well, having leftist views and you not sell it out, you probably genuinely have those views. pick up uh leftover crack, for example. Uh you know, it's it's authentic. They basically, hey, I want to piss on a cop car and smoke crack. You know, sounds like a good time. Then h Carl Marx. Uh but then there are people that they're like real hardcore edgy mode and you know, they pissed your parents got pissed off by them uh you know, when you listen to it or you're at this point in many cases your grandparents got pissed off at your parents for listening to it. that John Lennon is a big problem hippies stuff like that. Uh and then they just sell out. They they get soft and they try to they get hooked on the money mostly and then they realize well it pays more if I pretend to be like far-left because then I can go to this concert here. There's going to be 50,000 like communists there and so my next album is called Raise the Hammer and Sickle or something like that. They sell out. those that don't, well, then things like this end up happening. It's almost like the left enforces a form of bizarre corporatism. Hey, you want to make money? You know, all you have to do is worship at the altar of orange man bad, Tommy Robinson bad, you know, haha, it was great when Charlie Kirk got shot and stuff like that. That's basically what happens. That's about all. Peace out.`;
